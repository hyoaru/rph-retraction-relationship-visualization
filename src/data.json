Some view it as a betrayal of his revolutionary ideals, while others suggest it was a strategic decision aimed at achieving peace for his family and countrymen. However, we in Group 3 align with the view that Rizal's retraction can be seen as a nuanced decision, reflecting both a personal journey and a response to the prevailing conditions in the Philippines.",
